# ArmageddonTailwind

This is a modern web application built using the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2 and enhanced with two powerful front-end tools - [_**Tailwind CSS**_](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework and [_**Flowbite**_](https://flowbite.com/) UI kit.

**Tailwind CSS** is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that allows developers to easily create unique and responsive user interfaces without writing a single line of custom CSS. With Tailwind CSS, you can rapidly prototype, iterate, and ship features with ease, making it an ideal choice for modern web development.

**Flowbite**, on the other hand, is a comprehensive UI kit that provides a collection of ready-to-use UI components, layouts, and templates that can be easily customized to fit your specific needs. This UI kit offers a wide range of features, including responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and accessibility, making it an excellent choice for building professional-looking and highly functional web applications.

By combining the latest version of Angular with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite, your project can deliver a fast, responsive, and modern user experience that will help you stand out from the crowd.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
