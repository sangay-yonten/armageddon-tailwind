## Project Armageddon

This web application is a contemporary creation, utilizing the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2 and bolstered by two robust frontend tools: [_**Tailwind CSS**_](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework and [_**Flowbite**_](https://flowbite.com/) UI kit.

**Tailwind CSS** is a versatile CSS framework that allows developers to effortlessly design unique and responsive user interfaces without the need for custom CSS coding. It streamlines the process of prototyping, iterating, and feature deployment, making it an excellent choice for contemporary web development.

In contrast, **Flowbite** is a comprehensive UI kit that offers an array of readily available UI components, layouts, and templates that can be easily tailored to suit your specific requirements. This UI kit boasts features such as _responsive design_, _cross-browser compatibility_, and _accessibility_, making it an exceptional choice for constructing professional and highly functional web applications.

By combining the latest Angular version with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite, your project can provide a swift, responsive, and up-to-date user experience that sets you apart from the competition.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
